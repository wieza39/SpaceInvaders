# :alien: SpacevInvaders :alien:

**Hey!**

Here you can find project that I prepared as my final assignment for Java class at my university. 

It was first semester with this language, previosly I had experience only with C/C++ (on previous semester).
I learned many things in Java thanks to that project and in the end, all the puzzles from classes merged into one place.

Within 2 weeks, I was able to make such functionalities:
- moving ship with arrows
- make aliens moving around window
- enable ship's shooting and killing aliens (and make them disappear)
- score count
- import images (these I have to still change a bit. I was looking for transparent background for alien and ship, but all interesting .png that I found had regular background.

Features that I still want to add:
- aliens' random attack (I already started it, but I struggled with repainting the shot)
- menu
- final screen (for now is just simplified)
- UI of game like score, lives

Hope you like it and find it interesting.

**Enjoy!**

Jakub.
